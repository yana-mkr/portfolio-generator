AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

With a command line prompt, the application uses the users answers to create an html page.
The html includes the names, roles, emails, and additional information for the users work-team members.
Each team member option has an individual set of questions and the email and github URLs work properly.
